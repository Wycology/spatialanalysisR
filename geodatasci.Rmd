### Loading Libraries

Loading the necessary packages to use in the codes which will be helpful in 
analyzing geographic data in R.

```{r packages, include=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```

The data which I will use in the current work can be [directly downloaded](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f99ce43936d74f718e92a37a560ad875_0.zip), extracted, and saved in the subfolder called *shp* inside the .Rmd file folder.

The next step is to read in the data using `st_read()`.
